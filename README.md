Hereâ€™s a possible README for your HectorAI project:
HectorAI

HectorAI is an advanced home automation system powered by a local LLM (Large Language Model). Utilizing Raspberry Pi nodes, HectorAI listens for voice commands and processes requests via a local LLM server. The system integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant to control smart home devices and interfaces with services running in Docker containers, displaying relevant information on monitors placed throughout the home.
Features

    Voice-Activated AI: Nodes placed around the home listen for a keyword to trigger voice commands.
    Local LLM Brain: Requests are sent to a local LLM server running on powerful GPUs, ensuring fast, private processing.
    Smart Home Integration: Controls Home Assistant for managing lights, climate, and more.
    Service Monitoring: Displays real-time data from Docker containers on individual monitors.

Setup
Prerequisites

    Raspberry Pi with microphone support (for voice activation nodes)
    Local GPU-powered LLM server
    Home Assistant setup
    Docker services for integration

Step 1: Install LLM Server

Set up a local LLM using a model compatible with your hardware (e.g., GPT-based models). Ensure it's configured to receive requests from Raspberry Pi nodes.
Step 2: Configure Raspberry Pi Nodes

Install the software on Raspberry Pi devices to listen for voice commands and communicate with the LLM server.
Step 3: Integrate with Home Assistant

Connect HectorAI to your Home Assistant instance to enable control over smart devices.
Step 4: Monitor Docker Services

Set up Docker integrations to allow HectorAI to fetch data and display it on monitors.
